1al3d2f,"Are data engineers really just ""software engineers""?","Ok, to preface, I'm venting a bit here but it's also somewhat of a genuine question.   
Story - I recently applied to a senior DE position for a well known consulting company. For the record, I've worked in Senior DE/BI roles over the past few years and I have a number of former colleagues and friends who work at this specific company so I know their tech stack and business fairly well. Also, for the record I am not a software engineer. I can hack my way through python or an OOP/functional language but SQL is my native dialect. Anyways, I applied for this role and the only glaring omission on my resume was Python experience. Given that I qualified in every other way the recruiter had me move forward to the technical assessment. The assessment was conducted in codility and there were three parts, a python coding portion, a sql coding portion and AWS questions. Coming out of the assessment I felt pretty good but I knew full well that my python solution was pretty rudimentary (admittedly), however it was functional and passed the test cases correctly. Anyways, I find out a few days later from the internal recruiter that my test results didn't fare so well. Although my sql solution was excellent and most of the AWS questions I answered correctly, my python solution wasn't efficient enough and failed on too many edge cases. As such the technical team couldn't recommend I move forward with the interview process (much to my dismay). Now, again... I never said I was a competent Python programmer, in fact I fully admitted that I had very little hands on experience in a business setting coding with python but I'm very familiar with OOP concepts and can pick up any language if/when needed. Either way it seemed like in this case my solution needed to impress the team more than it did.   
So, this brings me back to something the recruiter told me initially... her exact words were ""our data engineers are really software engineers at heart"". I'm wondering if this is becoming more and more the case as time goes on. When I got into BI and DE years ago SQL was the language of most importance (at least in my past roles)... now it seems that that isn't quite the case anymore.

1al96or,“Lakehouse” - Realtime data,"So we use S3 for ingesting raw source data. We save it in unchanged format from source. Then in the next stage we transform them using python apps and save them as parquet files to S3 again. After that we take parquet files and load them into Postgres as final stage for consumers. 

How do you handle realtime events data in such architecture to make them available to consumers within lets say 1-5s? I think dumping data from Kafka/RabbitMQ to go through the entire pipeline (raw, parquet, postgres) would take longer and saving them directly into postgres is probably not a good idea.

1alffov,Is switching to Python from Scala/Java in big data worth it?,"I recently found out that my manager wants to assign me to a project in my company that will be in PySpark. The thing is that I have never really worked in Python, I've always been a Java/Scala dev. Should I agree to participate in that project, or should I stick with Scala/Java? Maybe if they don't find a Scala project for me, I'll have to find another job, idk.

I'd switch to Python, but it feels to me like some toy language that is a wrapper around something written in other languages, I've seen code bases in Python, they get messy, there's just a bunch of functions in each file, instead of having a class per each file with some name that tells you what it does. Also the absence of type safety is kind of annoying. Today I also found a bug in Apache Iceberg for which there's a workaround in Scala, but no workaround in Python, which made me think that Scala is better, once again.

On the other hand, I've been thinking that I should probably delve deeper into Airflow, I've always just kind of coded in Spark, maybe I'd write some simple stuff in Airflow, but I never actually coded anything complicated in it. Airflow is in Python and there's pretty much no alternatives, because everyone uses it. Can one consider themselves a data engineer without actually knowing much of Airflow?

I know some people will probably say ""Why not learn both?"" or whatever. In my experience it's not a good idea, because sometimes, in job interviews they ask in-depth questions about a particular language, for example how the GC works in the JVM, you may even be given some code and asked if it compiles... etc. You may have to write some stuff in Java or Scala using functional programming, and if you have been focusing on Python for a few months, you literally forget certain details of the syntax and tell the interviewer ""Sorry, I forgot how to do this one little thing in Scala, I need to google, because I've been doing some python recently"" and they may think that you are not the right fit for this job, you know?

What's your opinion on all this? As you can see I lean towards sticking with Scala, but I know almost nothing about Python, so maybe you guys can convince me that I should switch.",4,15,Outrageous-Heat-6353,2024-02-07 22:19:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1alffov/is_switching_to_python_from_scalajava_in_big_data/,0,False,False,False,False,"I recently found out that my manager wants to assign me to a project in my company that will be in PySpark.

I'm not a data engineer and I'm working now just using Colab for a project I need to automate. It fetches data from BigQuery, then process the data, does NLP inference with a few APIs (hosting the models elsewhere) and then processes it back to another BigQuery table. Not difficult stuff but because it will process maybe around 10,000 - 20,000 rows and uses several NLPs to analyze it, it can take up to 30-45 mins, longer if there are errors and so on. 

I have looked at Prefect? I'm not picky for the tool and can really work with low-code solutions as long as it is intuitive. Would be great to have it serverless and then obviously run on a schedule (in batches - one time per day) so it's easy to set up and run. Is there a tool like this that isn't super expensive?

1aldru6,Suggestions on warehouse and etl,"So my team's warehouse is an on-prem SQL warehouse and we use a mixture of stored procedures, CData Sync (3rd party tool), Synapse for ETL. 

Since the data is growing, we need scalibility in the warehouse. The different ETL procedures for different sources is an headacheare and we are highly dependent on CData Sync, which is another pain in the arsë. Our plan is to to shift our warehouse from on-prem to cloud, and keep a standardized ETL tool.

I am responsible for the analysis, but this is my first company and I've only worked here for 1.5 year (So I don't have much idea on what is going on in the industry as such). I don't know why I'm given this responsibility but I am interested in doing the analysis. Now the internet is full of amazing suggestions, however I would want to know the answers and suggestions from people who have experience working on different warehouses and ETL tools in the industry. Hence, it would be really helpful if you answer these questions - 

Any amount of questions answered would be helpful.

1. What warehouses and ETL tools were used in your past companies and your present company?

2. Which warehouse did you prefer the most and why?

3. Which ETL tool did you prefer the most and why?

4. Any recommendations?

5. What would you look for when changing the warehouse and ETL tool?

The different ETL procedures for different sources is an headacheare and we are highly dependent on CData Sync, which is another pain in the arsë. Our plan is to to shift our warehouse from on-prem to cloud, and keep a standardized ETL tool.

I am responsible for the analysis, but this is my first company and I've only worked here for 1.5 year (So I don't have much idea on what is going on in the industry as such). I don't know why I'm given this responsibility but I am interested in doing the analysis. Now the internet is full of amazing suggestions, however I would want to know the answers and suggestions from people who have experience working on different warehouses and ETL tools in the industry. Hence, it would be really helpful if you answer these questions - 

Any amount of questions answered would be helpful.

1. What warehouses and ETL tools were used in your past companies and your present company?

2. Which warehouse did you prefer the most and why?

3. Which ETL tool did you prefer the most and why?

4. Any recommendations?

5. What would you look for when changing the warehouse and ETL tool?

1al5i0k,Airflow - How to reduce cost?,"Hi,

I'm using Airflow since 4 years to schedule dags/tasks, in a different companies. Before that, I was mainly using cron on Linux servers, so I really appreciate Airflow's features.  
However, in my case, **DAGs and tasks are often quite basics**, and **do not require a cluster infrastructure**. The tasks are mainly python scripts, that use network resources (few memory and cpu).And only few people access to Airflow web server.

&#x200B;

The main problem here, it's that **Airflow can be quite expensive** in some cases. 

\- If you are using cloud services to host it (like Astronomer, Google Cloud Composer, etc..), prices can be crazy

\- If you handle the infrastructure, the maintenance cost can be also important (especially if you don't have dedicated team for that).

&#x200B;

But, in any case, I don't want to switch back to cron jobs for several reasons:

\- The main dashboard of Airflow is super useful, especially to spot errors

\- You can easily restart tasks in the past

\- You can easily access logs for a dedicated task

\- And other cool features

&#x200B;

So I'm trying to **host Airflow on a single server**. But, I have the feeling that Airflow is not optimal to run on a single server. First, because it doesn't support standalone database like Sqlite in production environment, so you need resources to run database server like MySQL or PostgreSQL on your server. Also, you have the web server that consume some resources.

I'm quite interested to know how you optimize costs? And what do you think about hosting Airflow on a single server? Do you know any other similar tools that are better for a single server infrastructure?

Thanks in advance!",1,1,4-sushi,2024-02-07 15:27:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1al5i0k/airflow_how_to_reduce_cost/,1,False,False,False,False,"Hi,

1al5dz2,Difference between Lambda & Kappa in detail,"Hi guys!  
I need to create a system architecture for a university course. 

Roughly said there isa fictional company that has an existing BI-system with data warehouse & ML-toolsto analyse historical data. Now I need to implement a real-time functionality to display temperature sensor data so that the workers can react quickly once the temperature is too high in the production machines.  
I could use the existing BI-system as batch layer and put a streaming layer on top for the sensor data. Now in my opinion, it would make sense to process all data together via Kafka & Flink and THEN send the processed data to the already existing DWH in the batch layer.  
And now we're getting to my question: There are so many different definitions as to where exactly Lambda differentiates itself from Kappa that I'm confused as to what is correct. Here's the different definitions that I read so far:

1. If the data source sends data to a batch layer AND a streaming layer (so sending it to 2 different places), it's lambda. So according to this definition, my solution would be Kappa because the data doesn't split right at the source, but instead after processing. So I'd put a Kappa Architecture on top of an existing Architecture.
2. It's Lambda if the speed layer sends data to the batch layer AND to the serving layer, so that it can be batch processed and at the same time be shown in a realtime dashboard. According to this definition, my solution would be Lambda.
3. It's Lambda if there is a Batch, Streaming & Serving Layer in the Architecture.   


If someone could help me to figure this out, that would be highly appreciated!",1,1,No_Dentist7884,2024-02-07 15:22:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1al5dz2/difference_between_lambda_kappa_in_detail/,1,False,False,False,False,"Hi guys!

1akzasi,Database / Data Model for Recommendation Systems,"Hey folks!

Has anyone ever set up a database for a recommendation system? 

I would love to know what database you used and what data model to set it up. 

I is basically collecting feedback data for ML outputs to set up a pipeline to refine the models over time and run A/B tests. 

The user information is stored pretty standard in a table with id, name, some metadata fields (e.g. tags), a description, and some more information. The recommendations are texts, so they are stored with id, text, title, and some metadata fields (e.g. topic, ...).   
What can happen, that too many recommendations pass through the different filters, so we rerank and filter them.   


I am flexible to set it up relational or NoSQL. The feedback is in form of clicks or likes and is related to the user and the item. So I probably need an interaction type, also the value for the interaction (e.g. in the form of up or down vote or a 1 value in the case of a click).  
If anyone has seen this in the wild:   
\- What database did you use?   
\- How did you set up the data models of recommendations and the feedback?   
\- What is the potential tradeoff between NoSQL and relational?   
\- Did you also store non-interactions (e.g., did not click), or should I leave this implicit?   
\- Should I even store this in one, or should I store it separately?

1aldbi2,AWS Lambda or SageMaker Implementation,"Hey everyone, 


I have a model and I’m ready to deploy in AWS.  I’ve been trying to research which implementation is best between Lambda and SageMaker and I’m hoping to get some informed opinions. 

# More Background 

1) The model is a PyTorch prebuilt model and works great off the shelf for our purposes, so we won’t need to do any training. (Otherwise I'm thinking we'd definitely need to with SageMaker)

2) Using GPUs would be great but not necessary. Does either option use GPU?  I would assume SageMaker could/does, but it's not clear from anything I've read.

3) Concerns around speed are huge.  We are expecting for the most part it will be quiet and then we'll receive a bolus of requests in the hundreds/min.  We're concerned that if the model takes to long to load or warm-up then it will lead to bad user experiences.  So we definitely want fast warm-up times

4) It seems that when implementing in Lambda we have the choice to embed the model in a docker image on ECR or placing the model artifacts in an S3 bucket.  Is one of those options better for speed than the other?

1al86xn,Switch to data engineering,"I recently got a new job...or so I thought.

After 3 years as full stack SWE, I was offered another role, also as full stack SWE. Pay much better than my current (nearly double).

In the time between signing the contract and starting, the original work was deprioritised and I've been offered a role as a data engineer in a different team instead (same comp and contractual job title still SWE).

I don't really know what it involves in detail. They mentioned AWS Glue, which I've never used and that the scale of data didn't sound very big (think they said 1m rows of CSV per day). It sounded like basically just ETL at a fairly small scale, but I may be underestimating the complexity.

I'm not sure what to make of it. There is a senior data engineer in the team that I'd be able to learn from (4 devs total but the other two also new to data engineering). And they said that the team as a whole would be upskilling to become more specialist data engineers over time so it would be an overall shift of career direction rather than a one off project.

On the one hand, that sounds fine. I've nothing against data as such. I just haven't worked anywhere before where there was enough data hanging around that data engineering was a standalone job.

Also on the positive side, the pay is great.

My concerns would be:

I don't know much about data; I've barely used SQL even in my backend work as most of it has been non-relational

I guess DE is a much smaller field than web dev so worried this would make me less employable in the long run (and unable to return to web dev for my next role if I don't like DE)

I'd be one of a number of newbies working on the project so not sure if I'll be learning best practices or the senior will be too busy keeping the show vaguely on the road

what if I'm rubbish at data stuff and fail my probation? At least with web dev I know I'm reasonably competent whereas my aptitude for DE is completely unknown

1alcsiq,Considering quitting current DA role in order to full send DE path,"First thing first I have enough in my SECOND savings (yes second) to last me 6 months, and obv longer if I cut down on discretionary expenses and even longer if I had to then tap into my primary savings, and even then that’s after a month worth of PTO I would be paid out. So just to get it out the way, financially I’d would not be suicide.

Secondly, I am a DA who is basically an excel monkey, I have been up skilling the last 8 months, I have personal projects and have cloud certs to match. 

The way my resume is worded, recruiters have been interested and are reaching out on a weekly basis for DE/BI/Analytics Engineer roles, I have already had one interview last week, have another scheduled for tomorrow and have a call with another recruiter today which could turn into another interview.

My day to day in my current job is a shi*t show, we are using excel well past its limits and the powers that be don’t care and want the show to run on. The tool we use, aka excel, always crashes and works against us heavily, deadlines aren’t realistic because again, excel. Zero automation, the pipeline report(again excel) is pulling from a DW SAP/Oracle source is never updated on time, which means our deadlines thus become fire drills every week.

 It’s really weighing on my mental health at this point because:
 1) I know there is a better way to do this
 2) I’m stuck using an absolute sh*t work flow
 3) manager and higher ups don’t care and don’t want change. 
4) and I can’t do anything about it

It’s very frustrating 

So part rant/ part question: Am I using sensible judgment considering this “break” in order to learn more DE concepts and put more effort into getting into the DE field? Or should I just stay in this position with trash tools to atleast keep a paycheck coming in while constantly fighting my tools? It’s one thing if I’m spending hours trying to get a code to compile, it’s another story fighting excel from crashing for 4 hours a day to just get the macros and pivots to work…

(I am by no means a DE super user, I say that to say I know my stuff but I’m not like a 10-20 year vet of this stuff, I know how make things work in the cloud/ETL/Python/SQL/DataBricks/SSIS/PowerBi/DB’s ect but majority of my day to day is just DA stuff (again with excel) but I have experience with SSIS and PowerBI.
